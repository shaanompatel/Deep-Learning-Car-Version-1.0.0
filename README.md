# Deep-Learning-Car-Version-1.0.0
Self-Driving Car Using Machine Learning

The purpose of this project is to use create a self-driving car. There are two methods in which that is done:

1. Using openCV to steer in a somewhat hard-coded manner

2. Using Tensorflow and Keras to steer the car using deep-learning (end to end)

In order to switch between these two, just change a line of code in the DeepPiCar.py file

This has been tested on a 64 bit Raspberry Pi using Linux. 

Depending on your hardware, a different version of Tensorflow will have to be installed. The version attached only works for arm64 systems.
